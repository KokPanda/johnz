            <p class = "dev_p">Silly me actually started learning programming from C#, which was obviously a mistake and i cringe even thinking about it now.<br>
                After dropping that halfway, i decided to start from scrath with much more simpler language Python.<br>
                So far i know basic web Developement and intermediate python. I know basic 3D modelling and photoshop which could help me
                make my first game in the future.
